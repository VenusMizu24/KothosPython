***HOW TO INSTAL PyQt4:***

1. Go here: https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download
2. Scroll to the bottom
2. From the list ABOVE the "Development Snapshots" text, download the 32-BIT executable for the 4.8.7 version; that's what I'm using.  It shold be the second one down.

I don't know how to install it from the source.  The initial Pluralsight course that tought me how to use it just said to use the .exe file.
